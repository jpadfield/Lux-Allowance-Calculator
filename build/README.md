# Lux-Allowance-Calculator - Build Folder

This folder contains all of the code used to automatically build a GitHub pages website presenting a live working version of the [Lux Allowance Calculator](https://jpadfield.github.io/Lux-Allowance-Calculator/). 

This tool is currently based on the [Simple Site](https://github.com/jpadfield/simple-site) system, with much of the custom features provided via a bespoke [Simple Site Extention](https://jpadfield.github.io/simple-site/extensions.html), which can be found [here](./extensions/luxallowance.php). 

All of the other required files, javascript, css, images, etc should be placed in the appropriate folders under the [docs](./docs) folder.
